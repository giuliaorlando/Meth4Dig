I want to win between fire and steel for them all

Removed the stones which hide the cave blind and dark along my way I must go on wise and brave before a last hail At the end of floor stairs of ancient stone lead me to a vision, an unreal hall 
And they appear in front of me lightened by a mystic flame A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates I can not believe oh what now I see when the two demons awake from the sleep

From the holy sea of golden flames Flies the last winged unicorn With its magic breath of innocence Rising to the crystal throne 
Skies are spitting 
Holy fire Wisdom cries and deadly whispers flow Flow down to silent mystic shores 
Shores of spirits Thirst for vengeance Waiting for their holy crystal gate Gate to the sunny holy lands

Tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake Swans and birds in water games will call Airin name, her name! 
And now is the time to decide On a way to escape from the cavern But the silver old chains on the wall Are now also trapping their souls

Also Dargor can't endure all... goes out from the cave while the demons take the hero for their tragic game Gods of earth save me from madness from these rites of total shame

Gods are raging leading my red steel heads and limbs are falling down It in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge "Black angel, I call you! King Chaos is raging in the torment of my heart... I call the holy earthquake to end this bloody hell!" Gods are raging leading my red steel heads and limbs are falling down It in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge while she comes, beloved sunlight 
On the river known as Aigor our hero found his way All the demons desperately search for him now but in vain They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land

The emerald weapon, the steel of the heroes Flow the black tears of dark angels Your blade is now serving the dark force... the evil source of the unborn 
the truth is there... in this hands 
Starless is my night, silent is my ride 
trough the paradox of wishdom... to the sea of souls Nel silenzio tragiche realta'... 
FIRE IS BLAZING FAST ACROSS THE BLOODY RED SEA THE SUNLIGHT IS FADING ON HIM / THESE ARE THE WIZARD LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE WIZARD LAST RHYMES 
We are reaching the brutal, the tragic dimension led by reflections, reflections of death the ghost in the fog... wander lamenting while violence devours my wasted brain 
Let me... awake! 
The astral bewitchment is the fatal witness of created surge of chaos I reflect the constellations' fall Now close your eyes and fight blind 
The moon is dying, don't fear his might 
Starless is my night, silent is my ride trough the paradox of wishdom... to the sea of souls
FIRE IS BLAZING FAST ACROSS THE BLOODY RED SEA THE SUNLIGHT IS FADING ON HIM / THESE ARE THE WIZARD LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE POEM TRAGIC RHYMES 
Fierce blows the wind, infinite fires on Elnor sea... hail to the king! He died as brave, oh valiant hero but so in vain, facing the storm... the storm! 
And soon the snakes of the abyss swallowed the mighty woodship while the waves of the bloody ocean were reaching the walls of the falling town... 
Starless is my night, silent is my ride trough the paradox of wishdom... to the sea of souls
FIRE IS BLAZING FAST ACROSS THE BLOODY RED SEA THE SUNLIGHT IS FADING ON HIM / THESE ARE THE WIZARD LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE POEM TRAGIC RHYMES 
2. Knightrider Of Doom 
The fading illusion the sirens' grey tears it here in the cold air the town tragic fear The breath of infernos the rise of the dead the portals of chaos the seventh black flame 
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN I WILL WASH MY SOUL TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM... OF DOOM! IN THIS BLOOD DAWN I WILL WASH MY SOUL TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM... OF DOOM! 
The rites of the unborn the dragonship fall the waves of my ocean the twins' holy call The march of the heroes the call of the gods after the rituals on the silent shore 
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN I WILL WASH MY SOUL TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM... OF DOOM! IN THIS BLOODY DAWN I WILL WASH MY SOUL TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM... OF DOOM!  WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD 
4. The March Of The Swordmaster Ride... die... sacrifice! 
Along the river of bloody tears the mighty steel shining in my hands we march and honor our brothers victims of Kron evil plan 
We cross the lakes of the holy woods to reach the ocean where red waves rule the black king is moving to Algalord this is the time... he has to be stopped! 
HAIL, HAIL! ...Brave Swordmaster! MARCH, MARCH! ...Great Swordmaster! and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...! 
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD... HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON... GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE! 
Between the waves of the raging sea 
echoes of warcries and battle hymns the underworld armies found their ancient queen the funeral march in the depths of the abyss 
The terror which strikes the honor which prays will be face to face in the mortal doomsday Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill it will test your courage... and your will to live 
HAIL, HAIL! ...Brave Swordmaster! MARCH, MARCH! ...Great Swordmaster! and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...! 
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD... HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON... GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE! 
To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky to defend mother life... Ride... die... sacrifice! 
5. When Demons Awake 
Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen awake the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron hands The vomit of evil, the venom of death is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain eating their flesh, devouring their brains 
Dead and vampires spit out from hell... is the new legion of the lord of the damned The vengeance of the gods, soon their heads will roll Oh, bringer of chaos... you will pay for all! Bowels' rain around me, brothers mutilated oh disfigured faces, flying army and bones Fuck you bloody bastard, demon raped soul die into oblivion with your shitty sons 
I THE NORDIC WARRIOR HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD I THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE 
Inferno apri rubami l'anima voglio sfidare l'oscuro demone Tutto e' in me, cielo e oceani fratelli gargoyles, volate qui da me 
Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen awake the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron hands The vomit of evil, the venom of death is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain eating their flesh, devouring their brains 
I THE NORDIC WARRIOR HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD I THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE 
8. Steelgods Of The Last Apocalypse 
Soon... winter again... ...snowlord come... Come and cover those grey walls... 
...VIOLENCE CALLS! I want his fall... his epic fall... in this evil war... ...fought to protect our ancient throne 
From this grey prison I look at you my lost and beloved wasted holy town I call the prophecy miracle the thunder of the ancient book word 
WE ARE... WE ARE THE ONES... WHO FACE THE STEELGODS OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE... ...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE! 
Now... Algalord lies... in the shades... of my shy mystic rainbow... 
...VIOLENCE CALLS! I want his fall... his epic fall... in this evil war... ...trapped behind these humid walls 
Raise all your eyes to the autumn skies 
capture the energy of that sight They can have fun with my limbs and bones but I swear my spirit will never fall 
WE ARE... WE ARE THE ONES... WHO FACE THE STEELGODS OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE... ...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE! 
9. The Pride Of The Tyrant 
Back into the fire I will have my sword He won one fight but not the total war Hurricanes will wipe out the dynasty of Kron The chains of steel can't hold the holy storm 
Sunshine is lighting the ruins of the ancient town the seven towers are screaming their pain so loud With my eagles I fly free from snowy mountains to crystal seas 
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT WE USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE 
Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words! You are the one who can still save your soul Akron is the bastard... he massacred all The evil hand that serves the will of Kron 
You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny Give me the power to show you that I am right With my eagles I fly free from snowy mountains to crystal seas 
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT WE USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE 
Seven flames to not forget, to be sure I not regret... ever! ...to become the rage of god... Chaos bringer worse than Kron... beware! 
Back into the fire I will have my sword He won one fight but not the total war 
Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words! You are the one who can still save your soul 
You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny Give me the power to show you that I am right With my eagles I fly free from snowy mountains to crystal seas 
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT WE USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE 
10. Rise From The Sea Of Flames 
Mirror of tragic reflections I break your glass showing pain pain for the infernal vision pain for that red bloody rain Trapped in this lonely oblivion dishonoured by acts not to name I search for answers forgotten trying not to become insane 
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me against the raging wind 
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING 
Hope of dark stone are now falling under attack of the ghouls crashing the high dragons' tower witness of legend untold 
My brothers run through the grey streets not spared by the queen deadly call some throw themselves from the high walls denying the torture of soul 
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me against the raging wind 
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES 
TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING 
1. The Dark Secret [I. The Ancient Prophecy] 
"It was a good time for all creatures of the earth, but fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon knight could bring a tragic end to this peace scarring their lives forever. Shortly before his defeat in the last of the primordial wars between the heavens and hells the evil son of the Hell God Kron, 
known as Nekron, withdrew to his lair in the underworld. There, sensing his impending death he inscribed a testament of pure evil in seven black books. One by one six of these books were discovered through out the ages, however the seventh, last and most terrible of all contained the secret of his resurrection. He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out his dark plan. But they were turned into stone by the angels of the crystal realms. And so his dreams slept with them until a time came when the forces of evil would usurp the earth. Nekron would rule in the unholy name! of cosmic chaos. And this time he would reign supreme!"

THE DEAD ROSE LED BY THE DARKLORDS OF HELL

[Iras:] "And so the Order of the White Dragon decreed Khaas the hero of the middle lands. He and princess Lothen from the kingdom of the ancient waterfalls, together with Tharish, elven king of the caverns and myself, Iras Algor from Hor-Lad, would travel the path of incredible danger and great adventure. Dargor the shadowlord would lead us through the ancient underworld of Dar-Kunor. Finally the time had come to find the legendary seventh black book, that containing the worst of all the known prophecies" 
7. The Last Angels' Call 
After five long days the final plan the wise words of Iras convinced all of them The path to Erloria could be a safer way to reach the grey mountains, Dar-Kunor old caves 
Epic horizons, majestic falls green golden valleys moving to north 
SEVEN WIZARDS CAME FROM DISTANT LANDS TO MEET KINGS, DWARFS, ELVES AND DRAGONLORDS ELGARD EYE CAN SEE THE FEAR OF THE WORLD IT THE LAST DRAMATIC ANGELS' CALL 
King Uriel proclaimed the last holy words the new sun was rising... it was time to go May the wise angels give them the strength to face all the fears that the darkness awakes

8. Dragonland Rivers 
They began a magical journey to the ancient dragonland For ten days they walked through majestic woods 
their vision ever at hand 
THE DRAGONS FLY IN THE BLUE SKIES THE MOUNTAINS SHOW THEIR MIGHT STANDING IN THE HEART OF THE LAND WHAT A SIGHT! 
See the deer, trolls and wolves, lovely creatures they're guardians of this land Such wonder and beauty lives in their hearts to see is to understand 
THE DRAGONS FLY IN THE BLUE SKIES THE MOUNTAINS SHOW THEIR MIGHT STANDING IN THE HEART OF THE LAND WHAT A SIGHT! 
THE RIVER WILL LEAD THEM TO URIEN THE MYSTICAL HOME OF THE GODS NOW A MASS OF RUINS BECAUSE OF THE LAST WAR

9. Sacred Power Of Raging Winds 
"NAIRA... ORIEL...TARNA... Majestic winds of the northlands... protect our heroes from the deadly Naroth... cover their tracks with snow... Rage on with all your fury... NAIRA... TARNA... ORIEL-NIRNAAN..." 
Dark is the way to the mountains of grey breath turns to ice in the air The journey is painful and longer than life crossing the rocks in the night 
GODS, LEAD THEM ALL TO HARGOR WALLS SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS KEEP AWAY FROM THE BLACK ORDER STEEL (THEIR BLACK STEEL, THEIR DARK WILL) 
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS PLEASE HELP THEM REACH THEIR GOAL TO HIDE IN THE SNOW SUN AND MOON HAVE LEFT THEIR BRAVE SONS

I don't want to serve your hellish will... [Vankar:] You are half demon... never forget that! You are one of us! [Dargor:] I know it well... for this I will pay! But I will deny you and fight you forever! 
Sacred power of raging winds fill their soul and the shadowlord heart In a magical vision Vankar appeared in Dargor dream while the four heroes were trying to rest He was born half demon half man... he struggled inside but would soon understand all would be payed with the blood on his hands 
GODS, LEAD THEM ALL TO HARGOR WALLS SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS KEEP AWAY FROM THE BLACK ORDER STEEL

Brave and proud at the last sun towards Erinor mount, The only way to reach there, where the air smells like death Mud, marsh... remains of a reign that have been frightening us for millenniums The black demon screams its hate, he wants to revenge the latest war 
Fire of freedom Flame of ancient times Awakes the ardor in their hearts Against the darkness That was an ancient evil Primordial in its reality 
AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES 
Only the eagles dare to fly there, beyond the peaks between West and North Hargor reveals its unreality which unveil fear in their eyes They have to leave for Mother Land, they even know that they may die the rock is strong but they are even more... a dragon, a lion in soul and heart 
Mounts with golden mantle reveal the truth walls and towers, immensity Grey majesty 
Black greatness In you is hidden the ancient evil 
AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES 
11. Shadows Of Death 
The old elfking Tarish knows well the way through the caverns to Dar-Kunor forgotten entrance For two days they walked in the wild 
on the pathway to darkness the reason they survived it was Dargor 
Finally they saw in the black and evil marsh There lied the passageway between snakes and hellish mud 
SHADOWS OF DEATH Follow behind into Dar-Kunor caves 
SHADOWS OF DEATH The holy mission of Iras' new friends FIVE HEROES READY TO DIE die for the whole world die to protect the green of the earth the green of the earth 
Black waters moving are signs - Dar-Kunor river the water is cold - the water is cold there Tarish dived into the marshes he soon disappeared 
into the black icy water black icy water 
Then, when he appeared they welcome him as heroes do. he found the caves of the ancient brother elves 
SHADOWS OF DEATH Follow behind into Dar-Kunor caves SHADOWS OF DEATH The holy mission of Iras' new friends FIVE HEROES READY TO DIE die for the whole world die to protect the green of the earth the green of the earth the green and the wonderful beloved our Mother Earth

12. Nightfall Of The Grey Mountains 
Holy angels of eternal light you who fell in the primordial age 
between these dark and grey lonely mountains who died to protect the green of the earth 
For Algalord and Elgard, Thorald and Elnor for all the towns of the known world for the icy northlands, the waterfalls' kingdom the dwarfs' western realms and the whole middle lands 
COLD MYSTIC NIGHT - IT FALLS ON THE PLAIN ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS REIGNS NOW THE SHADE ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH TIME NOW HAS COME DAR-KUNOR AWAITS 
Unknown threat - it fills the dry air the howling of wolves fades behind them they try to find rest between the wild rocks the one they soon see can be their last dawn 
The angels' lament breaths in the cold winds whispers of death surround the wide marsh Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls in front of them another hell gate 
COLD MYSTIC NIGHT - IT FALLS ON THE PLAIN ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS REIGNS NOW THE SHADE ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH TIME NOW HAS COME DAR-KUNOR AWAITS

THE DRAGONS FLY IN THE BLUE SKIES THE MOUNTAINS SHOW THEIR MIGHT STANDING IN THE HEART OF THE LAND WHAT A SIGHT! 
See the deer, trolls and wolves, lovely creatures they're guardians of this land Such wonder and beauty lives in their hearts to see is to understand 
THE DRAGONS FLY IN THE BLUE SKIES THE MOUNTAINS SHOW THEIR MIGHT STANDING IN THE HEART OF THE LAND WHAT A SIGHT! 
THE RIVER WILL LEAD THEM TO URIEN THE MYSTICAL HOME OF THE GODS NOW A MASS OF RUINS BECAUSE OF THE LAST WAR 
SEE THE FALLS OF ERLORIA THE GREY MOUNTAINS ARE NEAR DARK SHADOWS FALLING DAYLIGHT END IS HERE AND ALL THE CREATURES OF DARKNESS THEY WARN US IN THE NIGHT IN THE DARKLAND THERE IS DANGER 
THERE EVIL THERE TO FIGHT

"NAIRA... ORIEL...TARNA... Majestic winds of the northlands... protect our heroes from the deadly Naroth... cover their tracks with snow... Rage on with all your fury... NAIRA... TARNA... ORIEL-NIRNAAN..." 
Dark is the way to the mountains of grey breath turns to ice in the air The journey is painful and longer than life crossing the rocks in the night

[English translation:] [Guardians Of Destiny] 
Brave and proud at the last sun towards Erinor mount, The only way to reach there, where the air smells like death Mud, marsh... remains of a reign that have been frightening us for millenniums The black demon screams its hate, he wants to revenge the latest war 
Fire of freedom Flame of ancient times Awakes the ardor in their hearts Against the darkness That was an ancient evil Primordial in its reality 
AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES 
Only the eagles dare to fly there, beyond the peaks between West and North Hargor reveals its unreality which unveil fear in their eyes They have to leave for Mother Land, they even know that they may die the rock is strong but they are even more... a dragon, a lion in soul and heart 
Mounts with golden mantle reveal the truth walls and towers, immensity Grey majesty 
Black greatness 
In you is hidden the ancient evil 
AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES 
11. Shadows Of Death 
The old elfking Tarish knows well the way through the caverns to Dar-Kunor forgotten entrance For two days they walked in the wild 
on the pathway to darkness the reason they survived it was Dargor 
Finally they saw in the black and evil marsh There lied the passageway between snakes and hellish mud 
SHADOWS OF DEATH Follow behind into Dar-Kunor caves SHADOWS OF DEATH The holy mission of Iras' new friends FIVE HEROES READY TO DIE die for the whole world die to protect the green of the earth the green of the earth 
Black waters moving are signs - Dar-Kunor river the water is cold - the water is cold there Tarish dived into the marshes he soon disappeared 
into the black icy water black icy water 
Then, when he appeared they welcome him as heroes do. he found the caves of the ancient brother elves

12. Nightfall Of The Grey Mountains 
Holy angels of eternal light you who fell in the primordial age between these dark and grey lonely mountains who died to protect the green of the earth 
For Algalord and Elgard, Thorald and Elnor for all the towns of the known world for the icy northlands, the waterfalls' kingdom the dwarfs' western realms and the whole middle lands 
COLD MYSTIC NIGHT - IT FALLS ON THE PLAIN ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS REIGNS NOW THE SHADE ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH TIME NOW HAS COME DAR-KUNOR AWAITS 
Unknown threat - it fills the dry air the howling of wolves fades behind them they try to find rest between the wild rocks the one they soon see can be their last dawn 
The angels' lament breaths in the cold winds whispers of death surround the wide marsh Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls in front of them another hell gate 
COLD MYSTIC NIGHT - IT FALLS ON THE PLAIN ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS REIGNS NOW THE SHADE ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH 
TIME NOW HAS COME DAR-KUNOR AWAITS 
1. Triumph Or Agony 
Vision of darkness, mad gothic splendour rhyme of primordial neverending war carved in the wild rock under the ghost town sun of the darklands, black pride of Kron 
200 nor of unholy stone speak through the tears of desperate souls legend and myth will never reveal the infinite pain behind Nekron will 
Wars of the underworld fought by our brothers who never return 
Broken emotions wet from the shy rain lords of the lost time dream of great revenge no chance for mind rest, fear in the dawn breath what they will soon find can be just their death 
200 nor of unholy stone speak through the tears of desperate souls legend and myth will never reveal the infinite pain behind Nekron will 
Wars of the underworld fought by our brothers who never return 
IT OUR DESTINY TRIUMPH OR AGONY ANCIENTS' GLORY ENDLESS PAIN DEEP INTO THE DUNGEONS OF HELL

2. Heart Of The Darklands 
In the dragons' year 9000 after the sixth won war Nekron conquered the darklands so began his new reign 
His new bloody reign 
A whole town built on a rock as giant as a mountain portals made of angels' bones to warm men, elves and dragons Elves, men, dragonlords 
NO TRACE OF HUMAN LIFE THERE IN THE DARKLANDS HARGOR BECAME SOON THE HEART HEART OF THE DARKLANDS DARK GREY LANDS

3. Old Age Of Wonders 
Over the mountains the first lights of dawn the rocks around are covered by snow [Iras Algor:] "Come here my friends, enjoy this last view the sunlight reflections, the shy fading moon Many legends told by the jesters 
were inspired by the facts of a time now forever gone when our friends the elves lived in these lands when our friends the elves lived in these lands" 
OLD AGE OF WONDERS, OF ELVISH EMOTION PROUDLY SURVIVED IN THE MYST OF THE STARS 
MAGICAL DAWNS, HOLY VISION OF ANGELS LONG TIME BEFORE THE ELVISH WARS OLD AGE OF WONDERS, OF ELVISH EMOTION PROUDLY SURVIVED IN THE MYST OF THE STARS MAGICAL DAWNS, HOLY VISION OF ANGELS LONG TIME BEFORE ALL 
THE ELVISH WARS 
"During the first six primordial wars the elves found shelter between these wild rocks at that time this region known as Irith was green, majestic, heaven on earth When the sixth war was sadly lost for elves and unicorns this meant the fall Nekron found a new reign to rule so woods and flowers decided to die rivers and falls became suddenly dry from that time the cold darkness reigned the darklands became what they are today the darklands became what they are today"

4. The Myth Of The Holy Sword 
After the victory of the angels over hell these old lands became a new reason for war elves and men all united against new darklords it the time of the three elvish wars 
During the third one in Galfor old mines Naimur was captured by Atlon, 'hell fury' he got tortured by the darklord with the emerald stone and his brother left alone with the bleeding soul 
He took the stone he forged a sword 
AND HE ASKED TO THE ANGELS TO FILL IT WITH MIGHT 
SO IT WAS BORN THE MYTH OF THE HOLY SWORD AND HE ASKED TO THE ANGELS TO FILL IT WITH MIGHT SO IT WAS BORN 
After some years the elves' new attack dramatic battles and rivers of blood and for Loinir came the chance to avenge Naimur death just a strike of the sword, hell last breath 
He felt too much power in that blade he gave it to the wizards to discover why and the wizards knew right away that sword could have been a threat in the hands of the wrong man or darklords 
The wizards knew the stone was filled 
WITH THE GLORY OF ANGELS WHO ENCHANTED THAT BLADE THEY HIDE IT WELL BEYOND THE IVORY GATES WITH THE GLORY OF ANGELS WHO ENCHANTED THAT BLADE THEY HIDE IT WELL 
You know well what happened then the Loregard warrior and his quest he was the chosen to find the blade far beyond the mystic gates Akron army could be stopped thanks to that holy sword 
now it lies somewhere deep in the Algalord raging sea 
AND HE ASKED TO THE ANGELS TO FILL IT WITH MIGHT SO IT WAS BORN THE MYTH OF THE HOLY SWORD AND HE ASKED TO THE ANGELS TO FILL IT WITH MIGHT 
SO IT WAS BORN 
[English translation:] 
I still listening to the wind who caressing me aside forgotten crying eveving prisoner 
crying, forgotten crying evening prisoner an endless lighted breath I follow and slowly search for it in the fate whisper 
I LIVE FOR YOU, I DREAM OF YOU I SING FOR YOU EMBEDDED IN THE SKY SHY DYING STAR 
Of forgotten songs yet lived by your eyes now I live and take comfort... I live... my time in the hands my torment in your face the silence, my future anchored to one moment 
I LIVE FOR YOU, I DREAM OF YOU I SING FOR YOU EMBEDDED IN THE SKY SHY DYING STAR 
Sweetly lived eternal night dreams Now they' re burning betrayed by our memories Tears, tears of rage always lighted in my heart They're talking, waves are talking about a harbour, faded by now 
I LIVE FOR YOU, I DREAM OF YOU I SING FOR YOU EMBEDDED IN THE SKY SHY DYING STAR 
I LIVE FOR YOU, I DREAM OF YOU I SING FOR YOU EMBEDDED IN THE SKY SHY DYING STAR 
I LIVE FOR YOU, I DREAM OF YOU I SING FOR YOU 
SHY DYING STAR 
6. Silent Dream 
The silent storm in my heartbeat is raging at the questions of soul no way back, rising darkness blind angel in a night without stars 
Lost in the silent dream of a lonely broken love 
The fall of hope, of illusion is hidden there behind the wild rocks to reach the sun, warm my feelings I rise where only eagles can fly 
Lost in the silent dream of a lonely broken love 
FLY, FLY HIGH ENLIGHT MY HEART AND MY EYES BRING HOPE WITH YOUR HOLY SUNLIGHT THE ANGELS' FIRE 
The silent storm in my heartbeat is raging the questions of soul no way back, rising darkness blind angel in a night without stars

I BELIEVE IN WHAT THE WIND BRINGS TO ME IN PURE LOVE AND GREAT EMOTION I WILL BELIEVE 
7. Bloody Red Dungeons 
Lost in a sea of rising darkness fear and devotion meet again 
lost between rhymes of mystic splendour heaven is back to war with hell 
Nobody knows who planned that rock trap wild and ancestral spider web evil and dark red bleeding dungeons threat for the sake of mother earth 
Since the black army won its last war cold is the breath of ancient sin rites of unhuman dark perversion sad tragic years lost in the myth 
THE SILENT RAGE OF GOD ETERNAL HOLY CALL RED SUN AND MOON COLLIDING FROZEN SOUL 
Shades of a velvet wide horizon fear for a hopeless time to come fire and ice, the white flame courage angels' immortal blazing sun Lost in a sea of rising darkness fear and devotion meet again lost between rhymes of mystic splendour heaven is back to war with hell 
THE SILENT RAGE OF GOD ETERNAL HOLY CALL RED SUN AND MOON COLLIDING FROZEN SOUL 
Luna rossa, pianti, paure rabbia, ira, urla, torture innocenza persa per sempre ombre vagano eterne

8. Son Of Pain [Dargor:] 
While I crossed the mountains' side I recalled a memory days of anguish nights of pain your voice lives on trapped inside my mind eternally 
Those wise last words fade in my soul "You had the choice, you chose the light find your way darklands' son spread your wings then your heart will fly" Thank you, angels 
I am now reborn this may be my last breath and my final day 
I THE SON OF PAIN WELCOME MY NEW FATE 
Hell lost flame was life for me in that moment I felt free I was under an evil spell so now I want just to live again to live again 
I am proud, proud to lead my soul to new horizons, to the golden sky "find your way my brave darklands' son wizards, kings, elves and trolls" Thank you, angels I am now reborn this may be my last breath and my final day 
I THE SON OF PAIN WELCOME MY NEW FATE THUNDER GODS I PRAY I DENY HELL FLAMES 
9. The Mystic Prophecy Of The Demonknight 
Into the darkness they crossed the marsh and entered the frozen cave a secret path was cut into the rock a labyrinth a twisted maze 
an unknown misty haze Open Your heart then your mind eye 
Khaas' eyes focused on the grey rock he saw it in a different way the riddle soon would be solved an illusion was carved in the stone the arrows show where to go 
Trust in yourself truth awaits you there 
Crawling on their hands and knees dark is their endless journey so deep the cave of bats but they will go on and on 
THEY ARE THE LAST HOPE FOR MEN, DRAGONS AND DWARFS SPIRITS OF THE FORESTS SHY ELVES AND TROLLS FIVE GO FROM ELGARD INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING THE LIGHT TO FIND THE BLACK ORDER  IMMORTAL DARK RHYMES TO FIND THE WRITTEN WORDS BY HELLGOD UNHOLY SON PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING AND SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD THROUGH THE VALLEY OF SIN LED BY THE WHISPERS OF HOLY WIND INTO DAR-KUNOR A NEW SAGA BEGINS 
The well of dead souls appears, a red river flowing inside there no way to cross, there no way to climb they wish they were birds and could fly fly to the other side 
There a message on the dark stone 
They discovered a massive dark stone atop it a riddle inscribed: "walk in the bloody abyss, led onward by Nekron black will, find the courage in his name" 
Search your conscience read between those words 
"Yes, and now I know. Nekron name is all that we need to solve this mystery" Iras spoke those holy words 
THEY ARE THE LAST HOPE 
FOR MEN, DRAGONS AND DWARFS SPIRITS OF THE FORESTS SHY ELVES AND TROLLS FIVE GO FROM ELGARD 
INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING THE LIGHT TO FIND THE BLACK ORDER  IMMORTAL DARK RHYMES TO FIND THE WRITTEN WORDS 
BY HELLGOD UNHOLY SON PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING AND SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD THROUGH THE VALLEY OF SIN LED BY THE WHISPERS OF HOLY WIND INTO DAR-KUNOR A NEW SAGA BEGINS 
[Iras Algor:] "And so this new riddle finally revealed itself to me. The solution lay in Nekron name. In the Nekranos alphabet certain numbers corresponding to the letters of his name aligned in accordance with black geometry enabling us to walk on invisible steps across the silent abyss reaching the other side of the cave. Unknown horrors awaited us behind those two dark portals" 
[TARISH:] By all the gods of my Nordic lands... we are at the gates of death... [KHAAS:] They were built with the severed limbs of humans and elves [DARGOR:] ...under the orders of my father Vankar... [LOTHEN:] I can feel suffering in every rock... [IRAS:] Listen to the silence... [TARISH:] That must be the great hall... [DARGOR:] The unholy place where the Black Order was born... 
Since 5000 years, age of primordial wars the men of the known world read Nekron manuscripts power, blood and luxury attracted some of them who denied the gift of light, sealed their bloody faith to... 
Hell, Kron and his son he revealed to them the key to resurrect his soul he would be the avenger of his death Nekron once dead would survive in their faith 
HERE THEY CAME TO PRAY FOR HIM A NEW BLACK ORDER DAR-KUNOR WAS A GATHERING OF FOOLS 
EVIL SEED FOR NEW TRAGIC WARS 
Sacrifice of innocents, darkest rites with human flesh this was written in the books seven like the sins of men but horror fills the one that keeps the most terrible prophecy with it Nekron gave the key to awaken him from sleep 
Sad, dark, prophecy our heroes have to find it or the world will suffer the last book contains another key All the wizards know The seventh book the only hope 
THERE MAY BE A KEY IN THE SEVENTH BOOK A MESSAGE FOR THE EVIL ORDER HOW TO HIDE THE ANGELS' RHYMES SO THEY NEVER WILL BE SEEN AGAIN 
[KHAAS:] Great lords of thunder...the seventh lost book...there... upon the altar... [DARGOR:] Yes...that is the book...I am sure of it! I heard my father describe it many times... [TARISH:] Let us take it and leave this godforsaken place... [IRAS:] ...the legendary evil book is now in our hands... let us make haste...this was too easy 
[ALL TOGETHER:] What are these noises? What happening...what going on? [IRAS:] Removing it has awakened some nameless horror [KHAAS:] ...let us leave here now... 
[TARISH:] Look...there! ...hands coming up from the ground... [ALL TOGETHER:] Ahhh...come on...get away from here...let move! 
"Fleeing through the labyrinths with the hordes of the living dead fast upon them once again they found themselves trapped in front of the abyss. But with no time to think about black geometry 
they leaped into the red river 
for any death would have been better than the one waiting for them created by the hungry creatures of darkness" 
Ossa e fango ma il respiro c'è 
Covered by skulls and bones in Hargor marsh they found a way to hide from the sons of darkness who betrayed the angels' light 
THEY ARE THE LAST HOPE FOR MEN, DRAGONS AND DWARFS SPIRITS OF THE FORESTS SHY ELVES AND TROLLS FIVE WENT FROM ELGARD INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING THE LIGHT TO FIND THE BLACK ORDER  IMMORTAL DARK RHYMES TO FIND THE WRITTEN WORDS BY HELLGOD UNHOLY SON PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING AND SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD FINALLY OUT OF THE DARK THEY SEE THE LIGHT OF THE MOON THEY STOLE FROM DAR-KUNOR THE SEVENTH BLACK BOOK

"Soon the black book will be opened with consequences beyond any nightmare. Be ready to face its evil revelations. Today, at the whisper of the darkest winds, a new saga begins!" 
[Eloin:] "Pass through our middle forests safely, old friend, my heart goes with you beyond mountains and oceans I see what fate has decreed, I see it in the holy stars. The seizure of Nekron book is only the beginning of a great adventure and we shall meet again. We shall defend our beloved earth. Myth and legend ride with you!" 
1. Act I: The Pass Of Nair-kaan 
[Khaas:] Where are we Iras? [Iras:] Near to the doorway of hell... [Dargor:] Can you can you see? [Tarish:] No, but we must press on... What is that? [Khaas:] Howling... It coming from everywhere! [Iras:] Naroth... Run! 
Running fast, chased by the Naroth, they face the avalanche 
[All together:] What that? The ground...! [Khaas:] It an avalanche!! [Tarish:] No, hold on! Help me!

4. Act IV: The Betrayal 
[Iras:] What many believed was only a legend Was now lying in front of me... There it was... Erian book of the holy angels The testament of all the Heavens... beckoning to me A black dragon made of stone stood guard over it Threatening with outstretched wings As I drew closer my heart pounded But I cast off my fear and in the next instant I opened the book 
[King Uriel:] What Erian had written 5.000 years before Was now finally before their eyes 
[Dargor:] Elf of the caves! [Khaas:] Tarish, what in God name are you doing? [Iras:] You insane fool! [Tarish:] I do what must be done ! [Dargor:] Let him go! [Tarish:] Give me the book and I will spare the life of this old wizard! [Lothen:] Traitor 
[Iras:] He knows not what he doing! [Tarish:] I know very well what I am doing Hand it to me! Give it to me or he will die! [Khaas:] All right Take the book but let Iras go! [Iras:] No ! 
[Iras:] Take it from him! [Tarish:] Fools ! This belongs to the Black Order ! [Dargor:] Leave it leave it! [Khaas:] Ah I bleeding! [Lothen:] Help him! [Iras:] Do not let him escape Go after him! We must have the book [Dargor:] I will return with it! 
[Iras:] As I lay wounded An incredible pain shooting through my head I saw Dargor struggling with Tarish he won! But before dying, the elf king was able To tear some pages out of Erian book Then everything turned to black 
6. Act VI: Erian Lost Secrets

Tarish, your blood colored the snow Why old friend, did you choose the lie? May your soul now rest in peace And still ascend to Heaven glare

OLD SACRED WISDOM GREAT HOPE FOR ALL MEN FOR COUNTLESS KINGDOMS FOR THE WHOLE KNOWN WORLD 
Spirits of winter, lead our way Between the dangers of this cold land These ancient pages can not be lost The glory of Heavens clearly revealed

7. Act VII: The Angels' Dark Revelation  When I regained consciousness, I could see Dargor And around him a mantel of snow Oh, friends of the beloved lands We had survived Though racked with pain I called for the precious magic book I opened it and immediately realized how lucky we were Only a few pages were missing 
Those glorious words written by an angel Were there before my mortal eyes This was a sight I had lived my whole life Hoping one day to see 
[King Uriel:] All the divine wisdom of the angels Was contained in those ancient pages Tired and weary they came upon the village of Nairin On the eastern side of the White Mountains Home to the little elves There they could rest And Iras, after being cured by the elves' magic arts Could finally examine the mysteries of Erian work But what he discovered in doing so, he never expected Erian words were not only completely clear But they were tragic and prophetic as well A revelation of angels 
1. Dark Frozen World 
"Nekron dark pages proclaimed the worst Of all the known prophecies Erian book, the only possible way to stop it Had to be found 
The hour had come to answer The angels' last desperate call" 
2. Sea Of Fate 
Mirrors reflecting The broken illusion of one lost And sinful Mind eye protect me While caught in this dark world of fear And fading hope 
My soul is worn 
The sun lonely woes Of innocence lost In the shades now revealed By a fate never told 
A sea of new hope Won't fear his reborn In its waters we wait for The great heaven call 
Fragments of tortured Existence revealing cold whispers Of lonely Ghosts, led by shadows Enlightening the souls of all evil Of darkened faith 
And mortal pain 
The sun lonely woes Of innocence lost In the shades now revealed By a fate never told 
A sea of new hope Won't fear his reborn In its waters we wait for The great heaven call 
The call 
The sun lonely woes Of innocence lost 
In the shades now revealed By a fate never told 
A sea of new hope Won't fear his reborn In its waters we wait for The great heaven call 
The call 
3. Crystal Moonlight 
Lonely vibration of pure and divine Energy trapped in dead silence Tell about feelings now lost in a time Forgotten by all men 
Starfire, light up his unholy words Prophecy kept by the ancients And then reveal the last fate of all The world needs to know 
Moonlight Take my emotion now Moonlight Never forgive me 
Moonlight Romantic shade of the moonlight May you reflect The crystalline glare of my fate 
thousand and thousand of wandering soul Cry for the lust of a new life Damned to ascend but to come back again For great will of revenge 
Aeons infected, merciless space Tyrants of worlds now colliding I am the gate way, the seed of your mind The truth and a lie 
Moonlight Take my emotion now Moonlight Never forgive me 
Moonlight Romantic shade of the moonlight May you reflect The crystalline glare of my fate 
Moonlight Take my emotion now Moonlight Never forgive me 
Moonlight Romantic shade of the moonlight May you reflect The crystalline glare of my fate 
Moonlight Take my emotion now Moonlight Never forgive me 
Moonlight Romantic shade of the moonlight May you reflect The crystalline glare of my fate 
6. Raging Starfire 
In the winter night a lonely wolf Defying the coldness 
I recall his force to face The long way to the North 
Clash of the thunders Might of the starlords Rage of the ice storm Wrath of the gods 
For a new legend Dragons and angels Will storm the darklord Quaking his world 
The sacred flames of Heaven Forgotten winds of war Celestial wide horizons New golden rising dawns 
The embrace of ice and snow Could stop the bravest warrior But the thirst for justice still And more will warm our soul 
Clash of the thunders Might of the starlords Rage of the ice storm Wrath of the gods 
For a new legend Dragons and angels Will storm the darklord Quaking his world 
The sacred flames of Heaven Forgotten winds of war Celestial wide horizons New golden rising dawns 
Raging wild Divine starfire Burn dark worlds of ice and snow 
Raging wild Divine starfire Fates collide in your great source Wild immortal force 
Clash of the thunders Might of the starlords Rage of the ice storm Wrath of the gods 
For a new legend Dragons and angels Will storm the darklord Quaking his world 
The sacred flames of Heaven Forgotten winds of war Celestial wide horizons New golden rising dawns 
Raging wild Divine starfire Burn dark worlds of ice and snow 
Raging wild Divine starfire Fates collide in your great source Wild immortal force 
Raging wild Divine starfire Burn dark worlds of ice and snow 
Raging wild Divine starfire Fates collide in your great source Wild immortal force 
7. Lost In Cold Dreams 
Shy nameless whisper Ghost veiled of fading shade Your gentle presence I feel on me your hand 
Revealing sorrow The pain of times now gone Innocence bleeding A never answered call 
Feel me, tell me 
Take my hand and fly In the shadows Where your hopes are lying Where your stolen beauty Forever cries 
The cry of heaven The tears of angels A tragic destiny unfolds 
Breathe in my essence Of raining stardust I heal your wounds Beloved pure soul 
In cold dreams 
grey storming oceans Winds blowing all their rage Clack clouds arising And then just fear and hate 
Dear little sister They took your joyful smile Lady of winter Grant her a ray of light 
Feel me, tell me Take my hand and fly In the shadows Where your hopes are lying Where your stolen beauty Forever cries 
The cry of heaven The tears of angels A tragic destiny unfolds 
Breathe in my essence Of raining stardust I heal your wounds Beloved pure soul 
In cold dreams 
In cold dreams i lost In cold dreams i lost In cold dreams i lost I lost... 
I lost... 
8. On The Way To Ainor 
Farewell my last dear breathe of green Aranen flag fights cold icy winds White River flow, you led our way Now a new wild path to the fair plain 
Skylords arise Your thunders are quaking my soul Rage of the Heavens... storm! In me now it pounds your great force 
One more time We turn back sad but proud Just silence and grey rock Towards the last known town 
In ages of hate and raging swords Along these grey plains so wild and cold The armies of dragons, elves and men All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells 
And now we declare eternal war To every damned new hellish lord On the way to Ainor 
dark hells beware The angels are calling my name A sacred fate for whom Was born as half demon, half man 
One more time We turn back sad but proud Just silence and grey rock Towards the last known town 
In ages of hate and raging swords Along these grey plains so wild and cold The armies of dragons, elves and men All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells 
And now we declare eternal war To every damned new hellish lord On the way to Ainor 
In ages of hate and raging swords Along these grey plains so wild and cold The armies of dragons, elves and men All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells 
And now we declare eternal war To every damned new hellish lord On the way to Ainor 
In ages of hate and raging swords Along these grey plains so wild and cold The armies of dragons, elves and men All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells 
And now we declare eternal war To every damned new hellish lord On the way to Ainor 
10. Labyrinth Of Madness [Instrumental] 
11. Sea Of Fate (Orchestral Version) [Bonus track] 
Mirrors reflecting The broken illusion of one lost 
And sinful Mind eye protect me While caught in this dark world of fear And fading hope 
My soul is worn 
The sun lonely woes Of innocence lost In the shades now revealed By a fate never told 
A sea of new hope Won't fear his reborn In its waters we wait for The great heaven call 
Fragments of tortured Existence revealing cold whispers Of lonely Ghosts, led by shadows Enlightening the souls of all evil Of darkened faith 
And mortal pain 
The sun lonely woes Of innocence lost In the shades now revealed By a fate never told 
A sea of new hope Won't fear his reborn In its waters we wait for The great heaven call 
The call 
The sun lonely woes Of innocence lost In the shades now revealed By a fate never told 
A sea of new hope Won't fear his reborn In its waters we wait for The great heaven call 
The call 
12. Immortal New Reign 
Into the wide, sinister, cold Darklands One voice from the shadows is calling my name Trapped in a lie of silence reflecting The answers of fear and Heavenly woes 
Now I know to whom I belong Save me now from my darkest side While your sacred flame May wash all the sins from my bleeding hand 
Into the eye of scarlet horizons I pray that men sorrow have spoken my name Nowhere to hide my darkest emotions That innocents fell for the will of my hand 
Now I know to whom I belong Save me now from my darkest side While your sacred flame May wash all the sins from my bleeding hand 
We are the vengeance of souls went in silence We are the rage of the heavens in flames We are the pride of the earth holy dying We are the angels' immortal new reign 
We are the vengeance of souls went in silence We are the scream for the new rising dawn We give our lives to defend our kingdoms We fight the hells at the end of the world 
We are the vengeance of souls went in silence We are the rage of the heavens in flames We are the pride of the earth holy dying We are the angels' immortal new reign 
We are the vengeance of souls went in silence We are the scream for the new rising dawn We give our lives to defend our kingdoms We fight the hells at the end of the world 
1. Ad Infinitum [King Uriel:] 
The holy words of Erian Were filled with the power of the angels Their meaning clear as the glittering stream They spoke of the last of the primordial wars And of the moment when Thanor, the black dragon Turned against Nekron... And he revealed to the angels the place where he was hiding When the unholy son of Kron discovered this His rage cracked the Earth

4. Ghosts Of Forgotten Worlds 
One last illusion A powdered mirage Hidden feelings Swallowed by the red sand 
Sudden vortex of tormented damned souls Of blindness and buried honor I recall the sacred starflames The great fury of the tornado 
Holy force 
Water, fire Wind and earth arise Arise 
A lonely trace of sorrow One melancholic whisper A cell of silent matter Evolving to new forms of life 
Ancient flesh and blood Scream for vengeance Beneath this unstable surface The ground is shaking, the Earth is quaking 
It the dark fate they once asked for 
It nothing but sand after all Holy force 
Water, fire Wind and earth arise 
  STONE SOULS CAUGHT IN DESERT STORMS (DESERT STORMS) ONCE CHAINED GHOSTS OF FORGOTTEN WORLDS (DUSTY WORLDS) CHAOS BORN SAND LORDS 
Water, fire Wind and earth arise 
  STONE SOULS CAUGHT IN DESERT STORMS (DESERT STORMS) ONCE CHAINED GHOSTS OF FORGOTTEN WORLDS (DUSTY WORLDS) 
RISE SOULS CAUGHT IN DESERT STORMS (DESERT STORMS) ONCE CHAINED GHOSTS OF FORGOTTEN WORLDS (DUSTY WORLDS) CHAOS BORN SAND LORDS 
Chaos born in desert storms Once chained ghosts... 
6. Aeons Of Raging Darkness 
I won’t forget that day I won’t forget her name What has hell done to her Her pain’s flowing in my blackened soul’s veins 
Cold frozen night (Bleeding sins and lies) Nocturnal rhyme (Of unholy pride) 
Quake! (Crack!) Dare! (Clash!) Storm the gates of hell! 
MAY YOU BE THE ONE THE EVERLASTING FLAME OF HOPE GLORIFY THE ANGELS AND FIGHT THEIR HOLY WAR LET ME FACE THE BEAST AND EVERY SINGLE DEVIL’S SON I WILL FREE MY MIND AND I WILL SAVE HER SOUL 
Many don’t realize What it’s capable of What “evil” really is Far beyond its meaning as a mere word 
Her lovely smile (Brutalized and raped!) Her crystal eyes (She won’t see anymore!) 
Quake! (Crack!) Dare! (Clash!) Storm the gates of hell! 
MAY YOU BE THE ONE THE EVERLASTING FLAME OF HOPE GLORIFY THE ANGELS AND FIGHT THEIR HOLY WAR LET ME FACE THE BEAST AND EVERY SINGLE DEVIL’S SON 
I WILL FREE MY MIND AND I WILL SAVE HER SOUL 
MAY YOU BE THE ONE THE EVERLASTING FLAME OF HOPE GLORIFY THE ANGELS AND FIGHT THEIR HOLY WAR LET ME FACE THE BEAST AND EVERY SINGLE DEVIL’S SON I WILL FREE MY MIND AND I WILL SAVE HER SOUL 
Why you... why? I will free you! 
7. I Belong To The Stars 
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE 
Caught in silver clouds Enlightened by a mystic full moon You designed the horizon And amaze my minute heart 
Past, present, future Trapped in this concept of time I raise my mind eye To the infinite which lies 
In a silent night spreading wild Stellar might, dark Heaven Fill my art, trance my way Shining grace forever 
  ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE 
'CAUSE ONCE MORE I BELONG TO THE STARS I BELONG TO THE STARS 
Hiding forbidden truths Keepers of knowledge hard to define Keepers of velvet secrets Veiling softly our cries 
Jewels reflecting light Evolving cores of galactic life You who forged my essence The wild breath of mortal mind 
In a silent night spreading wild Stellar might, dark Heaven Fill my art, trance my way Shining grace forever 
  ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE

8. Tornado 
In primordial times of war Gods and men, dragonlords 
Fighting for a dead world A black sun will scare us all Gloomy past carved in hate Ready to be back 
It my time, my chance to show Who you are, who we are Shade of human terror May I cause the unborn fall Through new gates he will come For the end of all 
From empty shadows Electric silence In veiled reflections Of one lonely sunshine 
In the air my whispered name In the air... 
Now condemned to be insane Evil born, you will drown Swallowed by oblivion Once to darkness I belonged Deep inside, you're the same Godforsaken soul 
In my heart the angels' fate In your name fear and pain Violence and bloodshed May the thunder holy force Pound in me, burn my sin Storm once more 
From empty shadows Electric silence In veiled reflections Of one lonely sunshine 
In the air my whispered name 
  BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL BURN TO SAVE MY WORLD UNWRITTEN FATE FROM QUAKES AND VOLCANOS 
BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL RISE AGAIN 
AS TEAR OF ANGELS' PAIN AS CYCLONE, TORNADO AGAIN 
From empty shadows Electric silence In veiled reflections Of one lonely sunshine 
In the air my whispered name 
  BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL BURN TO SAVE MY WORLD UNWRITTEN FATE FROM QUAKES AND VOLCANOES 
BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL RISE AGAIN AS TEAR OF ANGELS' PAIN AS CYCLONE, TORNADO AGAIN 
9. Heroes Of The Waterfalls' Kingdom 
[PART I: LO SPIRITO DELLA FORESTA] 
[King Uriel:] The horns of war were sounding On icy winds the echoes of ancient fears will breathe again Soon on the edge of the Northlands The future of our world would be decided 
[PART II: REALM OF SACRED WATERFALLS 3:17] 
Warriors and dragons from the middle lands Knights from the Western far rocky plains 
Elves from the wide majestic green lakes Bravehearts from the South and the icy North 
The astral alignment will show all its might Be ready to get the stars' holy sign They show us all one true face of the sin The century last... last great eclipse 
March from the corners of the Earth (March for the Earth... all march) For the fate of your world 
In this day of doom and blazing rage Of clashing titans, anger, hate May the hells collapse again 

  IN BETWEEN AMAZING LAKES AND BREATHTAKING WATERFALLS VALIANT HEROES FOUND THEIR FATE RODE AND FACED THE BLACK STORM 
IN THE FURY OF THE WIND AT THE HARDEST CLASH OF STEEL VALIANT HEROES RAISED THEIR SWORD FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD 
ERIAS, THARIN, ARDUN, MORLA 
Mighty Earthquake, invincible thunder Now unleash your utmost power Lift the wings, the wings of our angels In this new and horrific war 
Send the North wind to freeze Any fear in our hearts Finally allied for an angel who spoke Against the unborn 
March from the corners of the Earth (March for the Earth... all march) For the fate of your world 
In this day of doom and blazing rage Of clashing titans, anger, hate May the hells collapse again 
Acqua ch'or scendi Or ruvida or stanca Nel quieto singhiozzo Tu scavi la roccia 
Or lava la mano Di quel mezzo uomo Che i trasparente Ti ruba al suo pianto 
  IN BETWEEN AMAZING LAKES AND BREATHTAKING WATERFALLS VALIANT HEROES FOUND THEIR FATE RODE AND FACED THE BLACK STORM 
IN THE FURY OF THE WIND AT THE HARDEST CLASH OF STEEL VALIANT HEROES RAISED THEIR SWORD FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD 
[Solo.] [PART III: THANOR AWAKENING 8:30] 
King Uriel: The news of victory spread like lightning across the land This battle ended with the army of darkness in total defeat Their unholy blood spread across the snow And dried black in the glorious sun of the Northlands 
[Solo] 
[Iras:] The moment has come We must hurry! 
[Etherus:] Take the eyes... 
[Dargor:] 
Alright Aelin fits perfectly on the left And Mornir on the other side 
[Iras:] The angels will speak 
[Dargor:] These vibrations... 
[Iras:] As I said it is the time of the angels No... no my brothers! Look at the statue Look and Thanor... look! 
... 
[Iras:] The spirit of Thanor rose from the abyss Where Nekron tortured his body and soul After his betrayal in the last of the primordial wars When the spirt reached the statue, the Earth quaked 
[PART IV: NORTHERN SKIES ENFLAMED 11:19] 
[Dargor:] Fly... fly mighty Thanor For your revenge and our freedom! 
A prophecy trapped between icy winds The words of an angel now cleary revealed The day of the last terrific eclipse 
Spit of the abyss, dark slaves of the beast Who creep in the shade of bleeding dark worlds Face us if you dare, we challenge you all 
Epic clash of immortals Demons, angels and men Fire raining from Heaven Chaos storming from hell 
A dragon condemned to abandon his world Could open his eyes, awake and reborn Led by the angels he could finally rise Enflaming the air of the Northern skies 
A battle too hard to be faced by a man A fight for who owns the magic of Earth 
A sacrifice needed to stop a new hell A mystical weapon, the forbidden spell 
[Iras:] Gods of light, angels of the highest cosmic spheres My friend Etherus, master wizard of the White Dragon Order Gave his life for the beloved lands Thanks to him Koras, the mightiest of the seven demons, was defeated Thanor returned victorious after destroying the six other winged demons In the darkness of the eclipse Guided by the divine light of angels he killed them all One by one, foiling Nekron dark plans And for what would be the last time he entered the main hall And magically returned to stone 
[Solo] 
In between amazing lakes And breathtaking waterfalls Valiant heroes found their fate Rode and faced the black storm 
In the fury of the wind At the hardest clash of steel Valiant heroes raised their sword For the sake of the world 
  IN BETWEEN AMAZING LAKES AND BREATHTAKING WATERFALLS VALIANT HEROES FOUND THEIR FATE RODE AND FACED THE BLACK STORM 
IN THE FURY OF THE WIND AT THE HARDEST CLASH OF STEEL VALIANT HEROES RAISED THEIR SWORD FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD 
FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD [PART V: THE SPLENDOUR OF ANGELS' GLORY (A FINAL REVELATION) 15:30] 
[Iras:] Thanor opened his eyes once again Aelin and Mornir were brighter than ever He stared at Dargor Still not finished... 
[Dargor:] 
No, no... Why me? Why? 
[Iras:] It is the decision of the gods and the angels 
[Dargor:] But I am half demon There is evil blood pounding in my heart You know it! 
[Iras:] That is the reason why You have met darkness and light... and you chose You are the most powerful of us all The elected... the chosen one 
... 
[Dargor:] So... so be it I accept my fate 
[King Uriel:] Dargor destiny was finally clear His death was only physical But from the rest of the shadowlord body A new form of life was born 
Erian angelic spirit now embraced Dargor immortal soul Combining the supreme energies of the cosmos To become pure divinity A god of cosmic light 
Did breathe on the Earth... again
